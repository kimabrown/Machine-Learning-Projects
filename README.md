# Machine-Learning-Projects
From ML class a few project we worked on using MatLab and Python.

1.	Download the MLP program from the course bboard page and convert it to a 3-class classifier (or rewrite it in Python in the same style â€“ level of abstraction) for the Iris dataset. Decide the best subset of 2-variables for the classification task. 

2.	Download one of the datasets below and use a linear perceptron and an MLP with one hidden layer for classification. Compare the classification accuracies (a linear perceptron code is also available on bboard).   

Dataset 1:  Brodatz texure Images 1.2.01 through 1.2.13 are histogram equalized versions of 1.1.01 through 1.1.13 and are marked with "H.E." in the list at the web address: http://sipi.usc.edu/database/database.php?volume=textures
You need to randomly pick 32x32 windows from these images (say 50 windows for training and 50 for test for each texture image)
